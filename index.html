            Population Dynamics in Australia
            <div class="subtitle"><br>Tracking Key Statistics Across National, State, and Regional Levels</div>
        </div>

        <div class="description">
            This in-depth analysis of Australia’s population dynamics highlights key trends in regional growth, age distribution, natural increase, multiculturalism, and migration. 
            Significant variations across states and territories illustrate how economic opportunities, lifestyle preferences, and demographic shifts shape the nation’s population landscape. 
            As Australia continues to evolve, understanding these trends is essential for informed policymaking and effective community planning.

        <div class="description">
            Australia's population growth showed regional differences, with Western Australia leading at 3.1%, boosted by the mining and energy sectors. 
            Victoria (2.7%) and Queensland (2.5%) followed, driven by urban migration. 
            New South Wales maintained steady growth at 2%, keeping its status as the most populous state. 
            In contrast, Tasmania (0.4%) and the Northern Territory (0.8%) recorded the slowest growth rates.

        <div class="description">
            Age distribution shows a slightly higher proportion of young children (0-4) in cities, with 2.96% of males and 2.81% of females in urban areas. 
            This trend continues across age groups, as families favour cities for better healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. 
            For instance, 3.63% of males aged 20-24 reside in cities, compared to 2.81% in regional areas, highlighting growing pressure on urban infrastructure and services.

        <div class="description">
            Natural growth (births minus deaths) varies by state, with Victoria (31,682) and New South Wales (30,776) leading due to higher birth rates and younger populations. 
            Queensland follows at 20,872, while South Australia (2,921) and Tasmania (321) see minimal growth, reflecting ageing demographics. 
            These trends indicate some states may depend more on natural growth, while others may need policies to increase birth rates or migration.
        </div>

        <div class="description">
            Australia's multicultural landscape continues to expand, with approximately 8.18 million residents born overseas, accounting for about 30% of the total population. 
            England, India, and China are the leading countries of origin for migrants, comprising 3.6%, 3.2%, and 2.5% of the population, respectively. 
            This influx has enriched Australia’s cultural diversity and contributed significantly to its economic vitality.

        <div class="description">
            Over the last few decades, the number of Australians born overseas has steadily increased, reaching 8.18 million in 2023, up from 3.89 million in 1990. 
            This growth illustrates Australia’s increasing dependence on migration to sustain population growth, diversify the workforce, and support the economy. 
            The proportion of overseas-born residents has risen from 23% in 1990 to over 30% today, highlighting the need to foster inclusive communities to ensure societal well-being.

        <div class="description">
            Net overseas migration is a significant driver of population growth, particularly in New South Wales (168,148), Victoria (151,740), and Queensland (82,794). 
            These states attract most international arrivals due to favourable job opportunities and educational institutions. 
            Conversely, states such as Tasmania (4,704) and the Northern Territory (3,920) face challenges in attracting newcomers, reflecting their more limited economic prospects.

        <div class="description">
            Queensland emerged as a top destination for internal migration, gaining 30,930 residents, primarily from New South Wales, which saw a net loss of 31,183. 
            This shift reflects preferences for Queensland’s climate and affordable housing. 
            Western Australia also experienced a net increase of 10,039, suggesting its appeal to job seekers. 
            In contrast, Victoria’s small net gain (537) indicates stable migration patterns and balanced population dynamics.
